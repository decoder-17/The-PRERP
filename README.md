# The PRERP
**An ERP System for Presidency made by Presidencians.**

A system which covers everything starting from daily attendance to semester results to assignment submissions.

In today’s world, automation has taken over most activities. Automation as a technological facility is a double-edged sword. It results in individuals finding it arduous to get jobs, as well as people becoming highly productive. Aside from this, automation also causes many individuals to pursue fraudulent endeavors with ease. Keeping such factors in mind, we the students of the Presidency have come up with an innovative solution to combat such situations. 

We have decided to create an ERP for the institution. This ERP comes with modern technologies that will play a pivotal role in today’s scenario. An ERP (short for Enterprise resource planning) is a holistic software that allows organizations to maintain track of their employees, activities, and enterprise. It is vital to focus on such elements as companies improve their overall productivity by relying on such applications. 

The PRERP, a holistic software for Presidency comes with excellent features that allow administrators to update different components and students to stay updated on their performance. The different modules like the attendance system, notification system, profile updating module, feedback forms, etc., allow all participants to indulge in this software and keep themselves updated on such different statistics.

Managing an educational institution is no joke. The administration must handle teachers, students, staff, and other stakeholders. They should also ensure that education is provided adequately. A website to handle all such issues plays a pivotal role in improving the overall accountability of the administrative department.

The PRERP is a web-based Administration System that allows admins to create different roles, update marks, attendance, feedback, etc., for each student. It is written in HTML and CSS for the frontend and JS and Firebase in the backend. The website also provides a dual theme for its users. The PRERP registrants can enjoy the benefits of the solution by customizing the theme according to their preferences.
